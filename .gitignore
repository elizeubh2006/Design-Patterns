To set up a .gitignore file for a .NET Core solution and avoid committing unnecessary files, such as those generated during the build process, you can follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Guide
1. 
Create or Open .gitignore File:
•  If you don't already have a .gitignore file in your repository, you can create one in the root directory of your solution.
2. 
Add Common .NET Core Ignored Files:
•  You can use the following template to ignore common files and directories in a .NET Core project:

# User-specific files
*.rsuser
*.suo
*.user
*.userosscache
*.sln.docstates

# User-specific files (MonoDevelop/Xamarin Studio)
*.userprefs
