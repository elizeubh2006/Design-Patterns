Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing new operations to be defined without changing the classes of the elements:

Financial Reporting System

Problem:

In a financial institution, you have various types of financial instruments like Stocks, Bonds, and Mutual Funds. You need to generate different types of reports (e.g., Annual Report, Tax Report) for these instruments. The challenge is to add new types of reports without modifying the existing financial instrument classes.

Solution with Visitor Pattern:

1. Financial Instrument (Element): This is an abstract class or interface that all financial instruments will implement.

2.Stock, Bond, MutualFund (Concrete Elements): These are the specific financial instruments.

3. Visitor: This is an interface for operations (reports) that can be performed on the financial instruments.

4.AnnualReportVisitor, TaxReportVisitor (Concrete Visitors): These are specific reports that can be generated for the financial instruments

Explanation

•  IFinancialInstrument: It has an Accept method that takes a visitor.

•  IVisitor: The interface for visitors, with Visit methods for each type of financial instrument.

•  AnnualReportVisitor, TaxReportVisitor: Concrete implementations of the IVisitor interface that generate specific reports for the financial instruments.

Real-World Benefits

•  Extensibility: You can add new types of reports without modifying the existing financial instrument classes.

•  Separation of Concerns: The logic for generating reports is separated from the financial instrument classes, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

•  Open/Closed Principle: The system is open for extension but closed for modification, adhering to one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design
